# Modereg
Modereg is an android based application that allows students to register for courses.  They can see the availability of the courses offered in the module and decided on which course to register. They have to register first as the students and be approved then they can proceed to register for the modules.
The faculty administrator is responsible for adding the courses and the posts. The students can then view the courses that are available, choose, enroll for them and also view and comment to posts.
